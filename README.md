# Pokémon EV Allocation Optimization

## Overview

The notebook includes functions to find the optimal distribution of EVs for a Pokémon's HP, Defense, and Special Defense stats. The goal is to maximize a combined score while minimizing the difference between two parts of the score.

## Base Stats

Note that a "base stat" here includes both the base and the IV. Please consult [Pokémon Showdown Teambuilder](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder) for how these values are derived.
